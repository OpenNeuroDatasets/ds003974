This dataset contains the native English speaker (L1) adult subset of the Reading Brain Project (RBP) data, focusing on 52 participants who underwent two sessions of testing: MRI scanning and behavioral tests, collected 2-3 days apart. During the first session, following the scanning of structural (T1-weighted) and resting-state data, participants performed a reading task with simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI scanning, and the session ended with a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan. The second session consisted of only behavioral tests, including five standardized tests: the Attention Network Test (ANT), Gray's Silent Reading Test (GSRT), Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-4), and Tower of Hanoi (ToH), followed by a survey:  Reading Background Questionnaire (RBQ), which includes familiarity rating for the topics of our five reading texts. The raw data are all provided here.
